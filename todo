What the game needs
    A core game loop
        Story
            Environmental/general story
                The story should give the player a reason to keep playing. Not the storyline, 
                but the story behind the world, the very reason the player is doing what they are.
                Why should the player come back to the game?
            Lore
                The storyline of the game. The backstory of the player, the world, and the characters.
                The relations between people and groups in the world. The story that is shaped by the
                player's choices.
        Mechanics
            A world
                Wild areas that are just plains/forest/desert/swamp/ocean
                Cities and towns
                Individual buildings and shops
                Ruins and abandoned towns
            A goal (this could also fall under Story)
                The thing that the player is trying to achive, such as
                    Defeating the great evil plauging the land
                    Earning fame, glory, and riches through their endeavors
                    Doing their job, they're employed as an adventurer/monster hunter/treasure hunter
